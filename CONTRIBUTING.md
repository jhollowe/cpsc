# Contributing to CPSC

:+1::tada: First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada::+1:

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to this site. As this is primarily a personal product, I would like to ensure all the content meets my expectations and matches a consistent format. Below are a few things to consider before contributing.

### General Workflow

For most things, if you would like to add something new @TODO@

## Design and Visuals

If you are skilled in web design and would like to make improvements, please feel free to create an issue to make sure your idea would be beneficial and then go for it and create a PR. Feel free to change styles and create overwrites for theme files. If at some point the theme is more in overwrites than the original theme, we can fork the theme and create a separate repo for the theme.

While there are some university- or organization-specific section, the theme and feel should remain neutral and consistent. Just because Big_Company is mentioned does not mean the entire project should be themed with Big_Company's colors and brand.
