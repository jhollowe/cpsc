There are three main navigation tools on this site.

1. The Navbar on the left (click the three bars if on mobile to see)
2. The Table of Contents on the right
3. The Previous and Next page footer

### The Navbar

The Navbar is the the main way to select a specific topic. Each main section will always be visible.
When you select a section (like "Intro" is selected now), all the pages in that section will be visible.

### The Table of Contents

The Table of Contents is automatically generated from the headings on the page. The TOC can be used to jump to sections of the current page.
Some pages don't need a TOC and may have it turned off.

### The Navigation Footer

The navigation footer allows navigating forward and backward through the site. A larger arrow indicates navigation to a new section.
