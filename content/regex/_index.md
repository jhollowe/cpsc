If you can read that, you can probably skip over this section.
This section is about Regular Expressions, or Regex.

### What is Regex?

Regular expressions allow you to specify a template to match against a string. This template can
allow multiple strings to match, allowing a variable entry to match a fixed rule. Regex can also be
used to extract sections from a variable string.

Regex can be super powerful, but it can cause problems if given strings that are unexpected or malicious. Attackers can trick a regex into validating incorrect strings or pulling the
wrong thing from a string. Regex can also fail to match valid data that is in a format that
you are not expecting.

{{<alert style="info">}}**Note:** different languages can slight differences in their implementation of regex. Make sure you test final regexes against your actual language.{{< /alert >}}
